## THE STORY
In this endless runner game, you play as Hikari, a young travelling mage who can summon lightning magic using her star staff. During one of her journeys, she comes across a quaint and mystical town inhabited solely by cute cats! Unfortunately, something terrible has plagued this poor town, causing all of the once friendly kittens to become aggressive (and knife-wielding)! It's up to Hikari to save these poor cats using her magic to make them friendly once again! 

## HOW TO PLAY: 
**Run the .exe file under the Builds folder to start playing!**

Press W or space bar to **JUMP**, and D or left mouse click to **ATTACK** (don't worry, you're not _actually_ hurting the cats).

Collect the pink, purple and blue stars; you'll need them to purchase upgrades in the shop. Beware of the cats! If they touch you, you'll lose a heart. If you lose all of your hearts, the game will end. 

As you continue to earn points, you'll notice the level will start to speed up. Don't get dizzy!

## EXTRA INFO
Made in Unity. All sprites, backgrounds, UI elements and additional 2D assets were drawn by me. I do not own any of the music used in the game.
